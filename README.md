# Vuforia

-Augmented Reality using Vuforia Engine, Unity and C# 

-An android application for android version >= 7, built using Unity and C#, based on Vuforia engine, integrating with it GUI.

-You have the following options:

1) Image Target Detection:

  You should prepare the image target and a 3D character will appear on it and tracked by it, so move it freely and test the character tracking it.

2) Money Detection

  Three currencies detection by recorded voice and a text label (100,50,200) L.E. 

3) Ground Plane Detection

  Ground Plane Vuforia detection by appearance of a 3D character,you should prepare the image target of Vuforia Ground and a 3D character will appear on it and tracked   by it, so move it freely and test the character tracking it.

4) Image Targets Clashes Detection based on distance calculated from their two centers

  Two image targets placed away from each other

  Upon getting them closer to actually collide

  The two 3D characters that were on them when the image targets where detected will disappear and reappear upon getting the two image targets away again

  Also a recorded voice will be played indicating the clash that has occured

5) Characters Clashes Detection based on box colliders and physics

  Same as number 4 but the methodolgy or code logic here differs as physics here is used

  Two image targets placed away from each other

  Upon getting them closer to actually collide

  The two 3D characters that were on them when the image targets where detected will disappear and reappear upon getting the two image targets away again

  Also a recorded voice will be played indicating the clash that has occured
